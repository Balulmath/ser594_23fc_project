Keywords: Football/Soccer, Result prediction, Sports analytics.

Description: Football/Soccer is a popular sport that people enjoy watching, playing, and betting on. When it comes to betting, we can clearly see that football is a    very unpredictable sport, and there is no solid research to verify it. So, the primary goal of this research is to develop a supervised machine learning algorithm that predicts football match results based on match information. As a result, the forecast difficulty level can be assessed.

Research Questions:
RO1: To describe the trends within data pertaining to football match outcomes and influencing factors across major soccer leagues.
RO2: To predict a soccer team's likelihood of winning a match based on the cumulative performance metrics of its players.
RO3: To defend the model used for performing the prediction in RO2 by evaluating its accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, as well as analyzing potential biases in the data.
RO4: To evaluate causal relationships implied by the RO2 model, such as the impact of specific player metrics on the overall team's success.

Intellectual Merit:The core intention of this research project is to not only produce knowledge but to bring forth novel insights into the dynamics of soccer match outcomes. While there are existing studies and models predicting soccer results, our endeavor seeks to explore uncharted territories by integrating diverse data sources and introducing innovative methodologies. In the vast realm of sports analytics, nuances often dictate game outcomes. By developing a predictive model that can holistically consider these subtleties, we aim to unveil patterns and insights previously overlooked or underexplored. Such findings, even if incremental, have the potential to reshape understanding and strategies in the domain of soccer analytics. By striving for this level of depth and innovation, this project stands to advance knowledge in the field, aligning with the NSF's criterion of producing new knowledge.

Data Sourcing:
The principal objective for our data sourcing approach is to ensure the collection of contemporary and reliable data pertinent to our research. In line with the project's requirements for graduate students, our data will encompass records from the year 2023, ensuring its relevance and timeliness.
Methodology:
Primary Source - Official Soccer Leagues' Websites: Many official soccer leagues and associations, such as the English Premier League (EPL), La Liga, and Bundesliga, maintain exhaustive databases of match statistics, player performances, and other related metrics. We will leverage web scraping tools like Beautiful Soup and Scrapy to extract this data. Before proceeding, we will ensure we comply with the terms of use of these websites.
Secondary Source - Sports Analytics Platforms: Websites like Opta, WhoScored, and SofaScore provide comprehensive soccer statistics and analytics. They often have detailed data on player movements, pass success rates, tackle rates, and other advanced metrics which could be invaluable to our research. These platforms often offer APIs or data dumps which can be utilized, ensuring we adhere to their usage policies.
Tertiary Source - Academic Databases: Platforms such as Google Scholar or ResearchGate occasionally have datasets attached to published research papers. By filtering for studies related to soccer analytics from 2023 onwards, we can discover datasets that might be beneficial for our analysis.
