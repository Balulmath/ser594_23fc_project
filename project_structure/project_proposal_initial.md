Keywords: Football/Soccer, Result prediction, Sports analytics.

Description: Football/Soccer is a popular sport that people enjoy watching, playing, and betting on. When it comes to betting, we can clearly see that football is a    very unpredictable sport, and there is no solid research to verify it. 
So, the primary goal of this research is to develop a supervised machine learning algorithm that predicts football match results based on match information. As a result, the forecast difficulty level can be assessed.

Intellectual Merit: Accuracy is a popular evaluation parameter used to analyze the performance of prediction models in classification tasks. The intellectual strength of our soccer match outcome prediction system resides in the capacity to construct very accurate predictive models. These models would not only advance the field of sports analytics, but they would also provide vital insights into the dynamics of soccer matches. Our project intends to improve understanding of the underlying elements and patterns that influence the outcomes of soccer matches by obtaining a high level of accuracy in match result forecasts, ultimately enhancing the state of sports analytics.

Data Sourcing: I intend to collect relevant soccer match data from a variety of sources, including publicly available soccer match databases, sports APIs, and web scraping techniques. The major data collecting method will be web scraping, in which I will create a web scraping robot tailored to the exact data we require for the research.
